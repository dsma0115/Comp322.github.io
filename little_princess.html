    <h1>The Little Prince Excerpt</h1>

    <p><span class="italic">As the little prince dropped off to sleep</span>, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
    <span class="highlight-yellow italic">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span class="highlight-orange">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
    <span class="highlight-red italic">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
    <span class="highlight-red italic">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> 
    And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="italic">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span></p>
